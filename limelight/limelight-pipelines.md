This folder contains configuration files for a Limelight 3.

## Python Pipelines

> [!INFO]
> Adapted from [Game Piece Position Estimation on Github](https://github.com/YoavRozov/FRC-Game-Piece-Pos-Estimation).

> [!INFO]
> See the [Limelight documentation for Python pipelines](https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/pipeline-python/snapscript-pipelines) for more information.

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python dependencies only for developing the pipelines locally. The Limelight 3 itself does not use any package manager (packages are automatically included by the Limelight firmware).
